# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
Created a Industry ready Data Analysis project using Python, MySQL and Power BI

I recently worked on an exciting project where I built a complete data analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to interactive visualization! 💡

Here’s what I did:

🔹 Data Ingestion:
Imported and stored a large dataset into a MySQL database using Python and SQLAlchemy. This helped establish a structured foundation for analysis and efficient querying.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed detailed EDA to clean, transform, and understand the dataset. Identified relevant columns and relationships to create a refined and optimized table in the database for further analysis.

🔹 Hypothesis Testing:
Conducted statistical hypothesis testing to extract data-driven insights and validate key business assumptions — ensuring that conclusions were backed by evidence rather than observation.

🔹 Dashboard Creation (Power BI):
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the findings. The dashboard presents critical KPIs, patterns, and comparisons, making it easy for stakeholders to derive insights at a glance.
